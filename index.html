            <h3>Network</h3>
            <p>
              A network consists of two or more computers connected for the
              purpose of communicating and sharing resources.

            <h3>Client</h3>
            <p>
              A client is a computer that connects to and uses the resources of
              a remote computer, or server.

            <h3>Server</h3>
            <p>
              A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and

            <p>
              A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a
              LAN or the Internet. Similar to a real-life package, each packet
              includes a source and destination as well as the content (or data)
              being transferred. When the packets reach their destination, they
              are reassembled into a single file or other contiguous block of
              data.

            <h3>Protocols</h3>
            <p>
              Protocols are rules that describe how clients and servers
              communicate with each other over a network. There are many
              different protocols with different purposes. These protocols are
              implemented by operating systems, browsers, and networking
              devices.

            <h3>FTP</h3>
            <p>
              The File Transfer Protocol is a set of rules for exchanging files
              over the internet. Unlike HTTP which is used to ask for the entire
              webpage and it's files to display them, FTP is used only to move a
              file from one computer to another. FTP is commonly used by web
              developers when they want to tranfer their local files from their
              computer to the server and vice versa.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>HTTP</h3>
            <p>
              HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for
              transferring files -- such as text, images, sound, video and other
              multimedia files -- over the web.

            <h3>IMAP</h3>
            <p>
              Internet Message Access Protocol: a way of accessing e-mail
              messages which are held on an internet server, rather than on an
              individual's computer.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>POP</h3>
            <p>
              Stands for "Post Office Protocol." POP3, sometimes referred to as
              just "POP," is a simple, standardized method of delivering e-mail
              messages. A POP3 mail server receives e-mails and filters them
              into the appropriate user folders. When a user connects to the
              mail server to retrieve his mail, the messages are downloaded from
              mail server to the user's hard disk.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>SMTP</h3>
            <p>
              SMTP is used to send and receive email. It is sometimes paired
              with IMAP or POP3 (for example, by a user-level application),
              which handles the retrieval of messages, while SMTP primarily
              sends messages to a server for forwarding. SMTP can both send and
              receive mail, but it's bad at queuing incoming messages, hence the
              common delegation to other protocols.

            <h3>IP Address</h3>
            <p>
              An IP address is a numeric ID given to each device connected to
              the internet. Every network has a public IP address and every
              device in the network has a private IP address. IP addresses
              sometimes correspond to domain names. The Domain Name System
              associates IP addresses with URLs with domain names.

              semantically describing the structure of a web page. HTML elements

              committee drafting and subsequent review by interested parties.
              Some RFCs are informational in nature. Of those that are intended
              to become Internet standards, the final version of the RFC becomes
              the standard and no further comments or changes are permitted.
              Change can occur, however, through subsequent RFCs that supersede
              or elaborate on all or parts of previous RFCs.

              .com and .net or they can be country codes like .fr or .zw. The

              software companies that build web browsers, such as Microsoft, do
              not always follow W3C Recommendations. This makes life challenging
              for web developers because not all browsers will display a web
